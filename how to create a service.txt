you have to write the file in the next path
/etc/systemd/system/
the name have to be: <nombre>.service
in this example is lab10arqui.service
example: sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/lab10arqui.service
inside of this file put the next:
[Unit]
Description=Extra lab for computer architecture
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/Desktop/ARQUI_2/lab10/lab10extra.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

this is to do a service that run a python file if you want to do other thing you need to modify this file

finally you yave to enable the service with the next command:sudo systemctl enable <nombre>.service and then start the service with the next command:sudo systemctl start <nombre>.service
